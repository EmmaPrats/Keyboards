**IMPORTANT: This design has NOT been tested yet, so print at your own risk.**

This case was designed for [QMK's plate](https://github.com/qmk/qmk.fm/blob/gh-pages/keyboards/lets_split/plate.stl) and [Wootpatoot](https://www.reddit.com/user/wootpatoot/)'s PCB (the one featured in [this assembly guide](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide/blob/master/assembly.md)).

It was designed with the measurements of an Elite-C controller in mind. It may or may not work with Pro-Micro.

It has the TRRS jack on the left and the controller on the right. But the design can be mirrored and it should be fine.

It has a minumum wall thickness of 2mm, but most of it is >3mm.

It is currently pending a printing test. If you decide to print it yourslef, please share pictures and settings :)

You can find the STL files for the whole body and the 2 halves separately.
